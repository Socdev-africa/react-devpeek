# Steps to Production for React DevPeek

Here's the complete guide to get your React DevPeek tool production-ready and published to npm:

## 1. Complete Implementation

Make sure all the code files provided are properly implemented and the structure matches what we've outlined.

## 2. Setup Type Declarations

Create a file called `vite.config.ts` with the build configuration we provided, including the library build setup.

## 3. Testing Your Package Locally

Before publishing, test your package locally:

```bash
# Build the package
npm run build

# Create a test link
npm link

# In another project directory
npm link react-devpeek
```

## 4. Prepare Documentation

Add comprehensive documentation to your README.md:

```markdown
# React DevPeek

A powerful debugging tool for React applications that provides visibility into local storage, session storage, and application state.

## Features

- üîç **Storage Debugging**: View, edit, and manage localStorage and sessionStorage
- üß† **State Inspection**: Connect to Zustand, Context API, Redux and other state containers
- üåì **Light/Dark Mode**: Automatically adapts to system preferences or set manually
- üì± **Developer-Friendly**: Draggable interface, collapsible panels, and search functionality
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production Safe**: Only visible in development mode by default

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-devpeek
# or
yarn add react-devpeek
```

## Basic Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDevPeek from 'react-devpeek';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {/* Your app content */}
      
      {/* Add DevPeek (only visible in development) */}
      <ReactDevPeek />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Connecting State

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDevPeek from 'react-devpeek';
import useMyStore from './store';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      
      <ReactDevPeek 
        stateAdapters={[
          { 
            name: 'myStore',
            getState: useMyStore.getState,
            subscribe: useMyStore.subscribe
          }
        ]}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 5. Preparing for npm Publishing

Update your package.json with final details:

1. Ensure the name is available (`npm search react-devpeek`)
2. Update author, repository, and homepage information
3. Double-check dependencies and peer dependencies

## 6. Building for Production

Run the final build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create distributable files in the `dist/` directory.

## 7. Publishing to npm

```bash
# Login to npm (you'll need an account)
npm login

# Publish package
npm publish
```

If you want to test your package before making it public:

```bash
npm publish --access=public --tag=beta
```

## 8. Promoting Your Project

- Create a GitHub repository with the complete code
- Add a demo/examples in a Storybook or CodeSandbox
- Share on forums like Reddit /r/reactjs, dev.to, and Twitter/X
- Consider submitting to product hunt when ready

## 9. Ongoing Maintenance

- Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Add tests using Jest and React Testing Library
- Create a roadmap for future features
- Keep up with React ecosystem changes

## 10. Getting Feedback

- Add GitHub issues template for bug reports and feature requests
- Create a Discord or Slack channel for community support
- Add analytics to track usage (optional)

With these steps, you'll have a professional, production-ready open-source package that provides value to React developers and showcases your skills!
