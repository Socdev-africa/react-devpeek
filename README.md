# react-devpeek

**A developer tool for debugging React state and local storage**

`react-devpeek` is a React developer tool designed to help developers inspect and debug React state and local storage data directly in the browser. It provides an easy way to view and interact with the state management and storage system of your React application.

## Features

- View React component states and props.
- Inspect and manipulate `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` data.
- Easy-to-use toggle button for opening and closing the DevPeek panel.
- Integrates seamlessly with React state management libraries like Zustand and Context API.
- Supports both light and dark mode.

## Installation

### With npm

To install the beta version of `react-devpeek`, use:

```bash
npm install react-devpeek@beta
```

```

## Usage

1. Import and add `ReactDevPeek` to your application.
   
   ```tsx
